        Michel has been an apprentice to established artists Matthew Barney
        (NY), Sterling Ruby (LA), and The Haas Brothers (LA). He co-produced
        Anti-Rabbit Art (2006), an installation created for the Multispecies
        Salon Exhibit (2010) in New Orleans. He also co-founded the Live With
        Animals Gallery (est. 2008) in Brooklyn and is a member of the renowned
        post-punk synth band Sextile. A self-taught artist, Michel is fascinated
        with the collective consciousness and believes the “universe knows more
        than we do”. The conversations generated between manipulated shapes and
        unrecognizable imagery echo a lost world. Within these language
        landscapes of never-existed realms lives ethereal life-forms that seem
        to drift into the galaxy. Between the omnipotent cosmos and the
        paintings’ surfaces lies a familiar and questionable comfort that hits
        hard. Michel is an enigmatic punk, an outsider caught in the inside. He
        makes the intentional look anything but and says “everything you make is
        a sketch for the next thing”. He’s a craftsman with an affinity for raw
        concepts and impermanence. His abstracted arrangements are intimately
        drafted without defined strategy. Predetermination defeats the element
        of discovery and overthrows the power of the experience. Michel feels it
        then does it. This process of cutting and manipulating paper ephemera is
        a meditative instinct that seems a welcome remedy for an unwanted kind
        of dissonance. Artist CAMERON MICHEL (b. 1978, Atlanta, Georgia)
        currently lives and works in Los Angeles, California.
